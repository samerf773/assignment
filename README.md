## Node Version

I am utilizing NVM (Node Version Manager) for managing Node.js versions, specifically using Node.js version 21.6.2 and NPM version 10.2.4 for my development environment. NVM allows seamless switching between different Node.js versions, ensuring compatibility with various projects and dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install packages if needed add --force

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

I am conducting tests to verify the functionality of displaying the 'Add User' button and successfully adding a new user. These tests ensure that the button is correctly rendered and that the user addition process functions as expected, including handling form submissions and displaying success messages appropriately

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
